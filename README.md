# CarND-Controls-MPC
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---
## Submission
This repository contains the code which I have submitted as part of the self-driving car nanodegree in term 2. In the following four sections I will answer questions relating my implementation.
For build instructions, see *Basic Build Instructions* at the end of this document.


## The Model
The trajectory of the vehicle is predicted using the bycycle model, i.e. we assume that the equations of motions are given by

![](./images/model.png)

where the state at some instance ![](./images/var_i.png) is given by 6-tuple ![](./images/var_state.png) and the actuator control signals by the pair ![](./images/var_actuators.png). Notice that ![](./images/func_f.png) is the distance function to the middle line of the road (which in our implementation was approximated by a polynomial of order 3).
The trajectory of the vehicle is predicted for a number of timesteps ![](./images/var_N.png) with equidistant time intervals ![](./images/var_interval.png) between them.

The set of states is given by ![](./images/set_state.png), the set of actuator inputs is ![](./images/set_actuator.png).




## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration
The timestep length `dt` and the number of timesteps `N` have been chosen to satisfy two requirements:

1. The predicted path shall cover the whole maneuver.  In the present setting, the controller shall mitigate road departure and align the vehicle to the center of the road.

2. The time of computation of the optimal trajectory shall be reduced as much as possible in order to reduce latency.

The first requirement sets both lower and upper bounds to the elapsed duration `N*dt`. For example, the screenshot below illustrates the typical situation where the vehicle has left the center of the road.

![](./images/N_dt.png)

The red horizontal line illustrates where a cut-off of the planned trajectory could be made.  Approximately the last third of this trajectory (indicated by the red horizontal line) follows the center line and is therefore well behind the reasonable horizon. If there was any traffic, the situation could change within a few seconds completely and path planning would already be useless at these distant points.

The latter requirement poses an even greater challenge for embedded systems. ECUs (Electronic Controller Units) will never have the power of fairly modern desktop machines for a variety of reasons (power consumption, costs, durability).

Notice that the length of the predicted path varies with the speed of the vehicle as the predicted distance can be approximated by the sum ![](./images/predicted_distance.png).



## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
The waypoints (which are contained in a deque of length 6) are preprocessed by transforming them from the world coordinate system to the vehicle's coordinate system as follows:  If ![](./images/var_psi.png) is the heading of the vehicle, and ![](./images/var_wxy.png) its global coordinates, define the two transformation matrices operating on homogeneous coordinates:

![](./images/matrix_rotation.png)

and

![](./images/matrix_translation.png)

The whole transformation can then be expressed as

![](./images/waypoints.png)

The waypoints in the vehicle's system are then fitted to a polynomial of order 3.


## Model Predictive Control and Latency
Latency, i.e. the time interval between the moment the signal is set by the ECU and the moment the actuators have arrived at their intended position, is incorporated into the controller by altering the initial state of the optimizer from the current measured state to a predicted state.

Let ![](./images/var_latency.png) be the latency (which is set by default to 100ms),  ![](./images/var_actuators_0.png) the current actuator positions, and ![](./images/var_pre_state.png) the current measured state.  The state of the vehicle at the time when the actuators will have reached their new position ![](./images/var_actuators_1.png), is therefore given by

![](./images/model_latency.png)

Of course, this is also only an approximation. The ECU itself needs some time to process the calculations.  Also, we assume that the actuators stay in the position ![](./images/var_actuators_0.png) for the duration ![](./images/var_latency.png) and are then immediately set to ![](./images/var_actuators_1.png).  However, these are still reasonable approximations.
